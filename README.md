# Real-time System for Remote Heart Rate Measurement
This system is designed for remote heart rate measurement, utilizing a deep learning model to capture signals from our face and converting them into heart rate readings.
## Introduction
rPPG is a non-contact heart rate measurement technology based on an RGB camera. Its principle involves utilizing a deep learning model to capture subtle color variations on the face and convert them into heart rate information. During heart contractions, there are slight color changes on the face. Traditional contact-based heart rate monitoring devices utilize PPG signals to derive heart rate information. PPG signals involve emitting light onto the skin and measuring the changes in light absorption to achieve heart rate measurement. Our deep learning model is trained using actual collected PPG signals as samples to learn the biological signals of heart rate on the face.
